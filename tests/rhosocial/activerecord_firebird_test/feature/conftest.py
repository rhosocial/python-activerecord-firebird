"""
Pytest configuration for top-level feature tests.

Provides the `fixtures` / `async_fixtures` placeholders consumed by
`test_features{,_async}.py`. The bodies of those tests are `assert True`,
and the @requires_protocol / @requires_functions markers operate on the
test's own requested fixtures (here only `fixtures`), so a stub is enough.
